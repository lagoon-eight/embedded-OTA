# Setting up the Raspberry PI

1. Set up Raspberry PI with necessary cables and hardware. I used a USB-c to USB cable. There was not enough power to connect to the iPhone adapter, so instead, I plugged into the power cable that has a USB plug.
2. Used a 32GB micro-SD card.
3. Installed Raspbian operating system, following instructions from this link:

4. Also need a micro-HDMI connector to connect the HDMI display.
